    "Face recognition problems commonly fall into two categories: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Face Verification** - \"is this the claimed person?\". For example, at some airports, you can pass through customs by letting a system scan your passport and then verifying that you (the person carrying the passport) are the correct person. A mobile phone that unlocks using your face is also using face verification. This is a 1:1 matching problem. \n",
    "- **Face Recognition** - \"who is this person?\". A face recognition video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wr4rx0Spihs) of Baidu employees entering the office without needing to otherwise identify themselves. This is a 1:K matching problem. \n",

    "FaceNet learns a neural network that encodes a face image into a vector of 128 numbers. By comparing two such vectors, you can then determine if two pictures are of the same person. **(FaceNet implements a \"channels first\" convention)**"
